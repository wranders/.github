All of my projects are governed by the
[Code of Merit](https://github.com/wranders/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please refer to that document before contributing.

## Submitting a Bug Report

* **Do not open a Github Issue if a bug is a security vulnerability**.
Please refer to the [security policy](../../security/policy).

* **Check to make sure the issue was not already reported**.
Search open and closed issues for relavant terms to make sure your issue isn't already being
tracked before opening a new issue.

* If a new issue needs to be opened, please fill out the template form.
**Please be clear and concise**, and include a **code or configuration sample** that leads the
application to exhibit the issue.

## Submitting Changes

* Please submit a [Github Pull Request](../../pull/new/master) with a clear description of changes.
* If multiple commits are made, please squash them before opening the request.
* Set the title of the pull request as the first line of the commit message.
* If any changes are requested in the pull request, please remember to squash those as well.

## Questions about source code
